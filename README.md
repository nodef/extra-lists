**Lists** is a pair of key list and value list, with unique keys. It is an an
alternative to [Entries]. Unless *entries* are implemented as structs by [v8],
lists should be more space efficient. This package includes common functions
related to querying **about** lists, **generating** them, **comparing** one with
another, finding their **size**, **adding** and **removing** entries, obtaining
its **properties**, getting a **part** of it, getting a **subset** entries in
it, **finding** an entry in it, performing **functional** operations,
**manipulating** it in various ways, **combining** together lists or its
sub-entries, of performing **set operations** upon it. All functions except
`fromEntries()` take lists as 1st parameter.

This package is available in *Node.js* and *Web* formats. To use it on the web,
simply use the `extra_lists` global variable after loading with a `<script>`
tag from the [jsDelivr CDN].
